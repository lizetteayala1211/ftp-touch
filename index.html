O how, like always, he invents the monsters underneath the bed to get you to sleep next to him, chest to chest or chest to back, the covers drawn around you in an act of faith against the night. When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look—it looks like a star. You had expected something else, anything else, but the wrench never reaches you.

He’s already finished making two of them, on sourdough, before he realizes that the fish is bad. What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They’re already made, but he doesn’t want to eat them. <br><br>

						After work you go to the grocery store to get some milk and a carton of cigarettes. Where did you get those bruises? You don’t remember. Work was boring. You find a jar of bruise cream and a can of stewed tomatoes. Maybe a salad? Spinach, walnuts, blue cheese, apples, and you can’t decide between the Extra Large or Jumbo black olives. Which is bigger anyway? Extra Large has a blue label, Jumbo has a purple label. Both cans cost $1.29. While you’re deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.

						Like sandpaper, the light, or a blessing, or a bruise. Blood everywhere, he said, the red light hemorrhaging from everywhere at once. The train station blue, your lips blue, hands cold and the blue wind. Or a horse, your favorite horse now raised up again out of the mud and galloping galloping always toward you. In your ruined shirt, on the last day, while the bruise won’t heal, and the stain stays put, the red light streaming in from everywhere at once. Your broken ribs, the back of your head, your hand to mouth or hand to now, right now, like you mean it, like it’s splitting you in two. Now look at the lights, the lights.

						You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar. The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose. Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy? The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for. Drink it, the bartender says. It’s yours, you deserve it. It’s already been paid for. Somebody’s paid for it already. There’s no mistake, he says. It’s your drink, the one you asked for, just the way you like it. How can you refuse? Hands of fire, hands of air, hands of water, hands of dirt. Someone’s doing all the talking but no one’s lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.

							<p id="written-copy-bottom" class="two"> Katherine Hubbard uses photography, writing and performance to plumb photography’s continuing significance. Considering analog photography as a mimesis of the body, Hubbard asks how its procedures might be called upon to investigate social politics, history, and narrative. In her photographs the physical positioning of one’s body has an essential relationship to how one processes images, exploring this encounter as a time based experience. Hubbard’s writing practice forms the core of her performances, culling the malleability of vision to frame a politics of looking, bridging the imaginary with the familiar. Hubbard received her MFA in 2010 from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College and is currently Assistant Professor of Art in the area of Photography at Carnegie Mellon University School of Art. </p>

						The urge to write comes in waves sound waves vibrational in the mind as in i can hear the language in my head differently then the speaking voice that acts as guide irritant self proclaimed protector the language comes in discrete sentences and with increased frequency i can only think of it as akin to being a child and told in quaker meeting that when the thought keeps coming it means you have to stand up and share it speak it out to the group so the thoughts keep coming and once this was considered to be the word of god coming from within the potential to be minister to be pastor to be conduit and we keep forming ministry into language that works to communicate express make whole and i am stuck in the thoughts that aren’t coming whole or the ones that i dont want to share in the first place and these thoughts stack like bricks forming half walls stumps for the voice to sit on i think about zizek and a documentary film about him that i once watched where he keeps his socks and underwear in the drawers of his kitchen and when asked why he replies something along the lines of living inside his ideas that they are not ideas separate from his ability to exist as a human as a being and i think about this as a way of doing something and i want bigger ways of doing some things about the collective fear that i have been told recently we live under and the collective attention to phones and phones being for the individual in relation and wondering how to rethink some of the collective problem from inside the collective psyche that we are sharing we are sharing we are sharing and i am reminded that recently i wrote to someone that we is a collective decision not a linguistic given and that we have the right to ask and we also have the right to say no yet saying it can be so deeply hard and then someone explained to me that the pri- mary difference they experienced being on testosterone was that the voice went away the voice that reconsiders and asks questions and hesitates went away the hesitation went away and in reducing the testosterone dosage the voice of hesitation returned and yvonne rainer taught us to say no so long ago and to so many things but maybe its just one of those lessons that we need to keep learning and maybe all lessons need to be learned again and again and again and the repetition we encour- age in children should be maintained and the repeating back we encourage from children should be maintained apart from questioning the very things we ask to have repeated back in the first place and then the question of teaching and then study is close to follow so i am reminded of fred moten insisting that study happens when we leave the classroom and loving the mis- pronunciation of words and saying that deviance is an original placement that comes before the norm and flesh comes before the body and considering the presence of flesh over the parameter of skin an astrologer told me to live in the ambiguity and life is messy and people are messy and this space doesn’t always feel good and not feeling good is ok and theres also life in the discomfort and life in pain and life in irritation even as we settle into middle class middle mind middle child in the middle middle age midtown we have to live in the middle and the implication of triangulation that inevitably points to ends in either direction and this middle is sinking down to great depths in the sea like everything else we throw away lit only by the phos- phorescent antennae of all the animals you and i will never meet and never see in person when i see images of these animals i am caught by the evolutionary path they have taken albino exoskeletons with engorged eyes much less sensitive then their nervous feelers extending in the dark with toothy mouths pushed from the face on a slow path growing closer to the source of food and i want to push you because maybe you need to be pushed and i don’t mind if you push me back even if i fall be- cause laurie anderson said falling is like walking and walking is a way that we can use our bipedal structure to move and when we move the brain works differently thinks differently remembers differently regards differently because there was a time when our movement towards a food source determined our survival and maybe the terms of survival have shifted and maybe we should talk about that and i think about love as an orientation as a way of knowing where someone is standing in a room and an energetic eye reconstructing the cyclopean image as something no one else can see and dont forget to breathe when you read and dont forget to breathe when you love just because the page didnt save space for your lungs and its so easy to forget the body or why is it so easy to forget the body and forget the flesh before the body and isnt all that comfort asking us to do that all the time to forget to go easy dont we neutralize anger down with words like easy and easy comes from the twelfth century old french aisie meaning comfortable rich well off so when we appease anger with the word easy we are saying the middle will make all this go away and someone told me they felt broken recently and ive never been this broke but i am so tired of the neural pathway threading broke with fear that i went in with tweezers and just took it right out of my brain and im storing it in a small glass jar of rubbing alcohol in the bathroom because the pathway is regenerating already i can feel it and im collecting pathways one by one each time until something shifts and sometimes i just want so much more space so i can spread and i want that space for you as well and i want you to want things and then want them for me and want them for the person standing next to me and is the record an ontological offense to the irregularity of performance be- cause i have been thinking about the record as an event unto itself events giving up the referent and it is a question of pres- entness and a question of time and a question of the logic of values and the value of logic needs a shake down too but the blanket is so heavy and sometimes the weight feels so good so its just another minute under logic just another minute wait just a minute longer under value and conjunctives and next and on like that practicing additive conjunctives as we walk around the perimeter evaluating the parameters that are required to calculate the parameters themselves which we are sharing we are sharing we are sharing and you havent done anything wrong

						love and heartbreak are fuck buddies who sometimes text each other at 10 in the morning. today, love asks: is this what the living do? as he tries to shit but can’t be- cause he doesn’t eat enough fibre or exercise regularly. it’s the little things that’ll kill me, he adds. heartbreak responds, ignoring the first message: you emptied your body into the floorboards of me. they creak when i am lonely. if i am a haunted house, then let’s make up a theory of negativity that notices the utopian pulse of sad stories like ours. well fuck, love types out. he deletes it. he sends a selfie with the caption: how’s this for a theory of negativity? heartbreak laughs. true, he quips. love doesn’t respond right away. he thinks there is something queer about leaving loose ends untied. love is a native boy from northern alberta who decided almost everything he does is an attempt to repair the brokenness-of-being that is indigeneity. last month, love fucked a security guard in the basement of a parkade at midnight. locking the door behind love, the security guard joked, don’t worry, i’m not going to kill you or anything. love wonders if it is the possibility of being killed that partly animates his desires. that’s fucked up, heartbreak tells love when love tells him this story. love hypothesizes that the parkade basement might be a metonym for the world. heartbreak thinks out loud: how do you know when the world is not that basement anymore? love answers: my kookum and mooshum don’t use pronouns or proper nouns to address one another: they made their own language. that is how.

He moved to New York City in 1990 where he attended Hunter College and the Whitney Independent Study Program. Pfeiffer’s work in video, sculpture, and photography revisits the history of popular mass entertain- ment to explore the role of images in shaping individual and collective consciousness. Reworking clips from YouTube, cable TV, and increasingly his own footage, Pfeiffer delves deeply into the aesthetics of non-linear editing to elucidate the hybrid forms of space and time that define day-to-day experience in the contemporary world. He has participated in solo and group exhibitions around the world. For the Performa 19 Biennial, Pfeiffer presented his first live performance in collaboration with The Georgia Redcoat Marching Band from the University of Georgia, at the Apollo Theater on November 11, 2019.

				<div class="scroll-left" title="Cyclops and Slashes">
					<marquee behavior="scroll" direction="left" scrollamount="15"> The urge to write comes in waves sound waves vibrational in the mind as in i can hear the language in my head differently then the speaking voice that acts as guide irritant self proclaimed protector the language comes in discrete sentences and with increased frequency i can only think of it as akin to being a child and told in quaker meeting that when the thought keeps coming it means you have to stand up and share it speak it out to the group so the thoughts keep coming and once this was considered to be the word of god coming from within the potential to be minister to be pastor to be conduit and we keep forming ministry into language that works to communicate express make whole and i am stuck in the thoughts that aren’t coming whole or the ones that i dont want to share in the first place and these thoughts stack like bricks forming half walls stumps for the voice to sit on i think about zizek and a documentary film about him that i once watched where he keeps his socks and underwear in the drawers of his kitchen and when asked why he replies something along the lines of living inside his ideas that they are not ideas separate from his ability to exist as a human as a being and i think about this as a way of doing something and i want bigger ways of doing some things about the collective fear that i have been told recently we live under and the collective attention to phones and phones being for the individual in relation and wondering how to rethink some of the collective problem from inside the collective psyche that we are sharing we are sharing we are sharing and i am reminded that recently i wrote to someone that we is a collective decision not a linguistic given and that we have the right to ask and we also have the right to say no yet saying it can be so deeply hard and then someone explained to me that the primary difference they experienced being on testosterone was that the voice went away the voice that reconsiders and asks questions and hesitates went away the hesitation went away and in reducing the testosterone dosage the voice of hesitation returned and yvonne rainer taught us to say no so long ago and to so many things but maybe its just one of those lessons that we need to keep learning and maybe all lessons need to be learned again and again and again and the repetition we encourage in children should be maintained and the repeating back we encourage from children should be maintained apart from questioning the very things we ask to have repeated back in the first place and then the question of teaching and then study is close to follow so i am reminded of fred moten insisting that study happens when we leave the classroom and loving the mispronunciation of words and saying that deviance is an original placement that comes before the norm and flesh comes before the body and considering the presence of flesh over the parameter of skin an astrologer told me to live in the ambiguity and life is messy and people are messy and this space doesn’t always feel good and not feeling good is ok and theres also life in the discomfort and life in pain and life in irritation even as we settle into middle class middle mind middle child in the middle middle age midtown we have to live in the middle and the implication of triangulation that inevitably points to ends in either direction and this middle is sinking down to great depths in the sea like everything else we throw away lit only by the phosphorescent antennae of all the animals you and i will never meet and never see in person when i see images of these animals i am caught by the evolutionary path they have taken albino exoskeletons with engorged eyes much less sensitive then their nervous feelers extending in the dark with toothy mouths pushed from the face on a slow path growing closer to the source of food and i want to push you because maybe you need to be pushed and i don’t mind if you push me back even if i fall because laurie anderson said falling is like walking and walking is a way that we can use our bipedal structure to move and when we move the brain works differently thinks differently remembers differently regards differently because there was a time when our movement towards a food source determined our survival and maybe the terms of survival have shifted and maybe we should talk about that and i think about love as an orientation as a way of knowing where someone is standing in a room and an energetic eye reconstructing the cyclopean image as something no one else can see and dont forget to breathe when you read and dont forget to breathe when you love just because the page didnt save space for your lungs and its so easy to forget the body or why is it so easy to forget the body and forget the flesh before the body and isnt all that comfort asking us to do that all the time to forget to go easy dont we neutralize anger down with words like easy and easy comes from the twelfth century old french aisie meaning comfortable rich well off so when we appease anger with the word easy we are saying the middle will make all this go away and someone told me they felt broken recently and ive never been this broke but i am so tired of the neural pathway threading broke with fear that i went in with tweezers and just took it right out of my brain and im storing it in a small glass jar of rubbing alcohol in the bathroom because the pathway is regenerating already i can feel it and im collecting pathways one by one each time until something shifts and sometimes i just want so much more space so i can spread and i want that space for you as well and i want you to want things and then want them for me and want them for the person standing next to me and is the record an ontological offense to the irregularity of performance because i have been thinking about the record as an event unto itself events giving up the referent and it is a question of presentness and a question of time and a question of the logic of values and the value of logic needs a shake down too but the blanket is so heavy and sometimes the weight feels so good so its just another minute under logic just another minute wait just a minute longer under value and conjunctives and next and on like that practicing additive conjunctives as we walk around the perimeter evaluating the parameters that are required to calculate the parameters themselves which we are sharing we are sharing we are sharing and you havent done anything wrong
